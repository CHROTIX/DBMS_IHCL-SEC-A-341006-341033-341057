# IHCL (Taj Hotels) Database Management System – MySQL Project

## Project Overview
This project is a simple database management system designed for IHCL (Indian Hotels Company Limited – Taj Hotels).  
It has been created as part of an MBA coursework to understand the basics of SQL, relational databases, and how real-world business operations can be represented using tables and relationships.

The focus of this project is **learning SQL concepts**, not advanced optimization or professional-level database design.

## Objective of the Project
The main objective of this project is to:
- Understand how hotel operations can be stored in a database
- Learn how tables are created and linked using primary and foreign keys
- Practice basic SQL operations such as CREATE, INSERT, and SELECT
- Represent a real hospitality business using simple relational logic

---

## Database Description
The database covers key operational areas of Taj Hotels such as:
- Hotel details
- Rooms and availability
- Customer information
- Bookings and payments
- Employees working at different hotels
- Loyalty program details
- Services used by guests during their stay

Each table is connected using foreign keys to maintain relationships and data integrity.

## Learning Outcome
Through this project, I learned:
- How to design a simple relational database
- How foreign keys help in connecting tables
- How business processes can be converted into database structures
- How to retrieve meaningful data using SQL queries
